1. Purpose
The Purpose of this thorn is to extend EOS_Omni to be able to read and use
3-parameter Equation of State (EOS) tables.

2. Usage
This thorn should be used in place of EOS_Omni as it uses the same 
function alias names in order to be compatible with stock GRHydro. The 
provided functions are:

EOS_Omni_GetHandle -Returns Equation of State key used by all other 
funtions for switching behaviour based on chosen EOS.

EOS_Omni_press -Determines pressure from density, specific internal energy
or temperature, and electron fraction.

EOS_Omni_press_cs2 -Determines pressure and speed of sound squared from
density, specific internal energy or temperature, and electron fraction.

EOS_Omni_pressOMP -Same as EOS_Omni_Press, but using OMP for
parallelisation.

EOS_Omni_DPressByDEps -Determines derivative of pressure wrt specific
internal energy given density, specific internal energy or temperature,
and electron fraction.

EOS_Omni_DPressByDRho -Determines derivative of pressure wrt density given
density, specific internal energy or temperature, and electron fraction.

EOS_Omni_dpderho_dpdrhoe -Todo

EOS_Omni_cs2 -Determines speed of sound squared given density, specific
internal energy or temperature, and electron fraction.

EOS_Omni_EpsFromPress -Determines specific internal energy given density,
electron fraction, and pressure.

This thorn takes parameters:
